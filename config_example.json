  "description": "On one side of the debate, some may argue that environmental concerns are being overemphasized, possibly affecting the overall experience of such events. They might suggest that options like vegetarian meals and wooden utensils are unnecessary measures.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some argue for drastic and immediate overhaul of our traditional academic event formats, advocating for a nearly complete shift to online formats and significantly reduced event frequency, emphasizing that if the scientific community doesn't take radical steps towards environmental responsibility, who will?\n\nIn the middle, there are also considerations of the post-pandemic reality and the importance of in-person networking for early-career researchers, as well as the potential mental health implications of limiting such opportunities.",
  "scale": "where 0 represents the belief that environmental concerns are overblown, while 10 indicates the belief that extreme, radical changes to our event formats are urgent and necessary.",
