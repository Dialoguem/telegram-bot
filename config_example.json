Or that the impact of this class of events is negligible compared to other types of human activity\\.\n\n⏩ *On the other end* of the spectrum, some may consider that if our community doesn't take radical steps towards environmental responsibility, who will? Thus advocating for a nearly complete shift to online formats and significantly reduced event frequency\\.\n\n⏸ *In the middle,* there could be also considerations of the post\\-pandemic reality and potential mental health implications of limiting such opportunities, as well as the importance of in\\-person networking for new comers\\.",
